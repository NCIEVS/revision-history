# Revision History

A plug-in for Protégé 5 that provides a user interface for Workflow Managers to review the work of modelers.
This GUI was originally developed by [Stanford][1] for use at NCI and subsequently enhanced further by NCI to support ongoing requirements.

It requires the [protege-client][2] also be installed.
